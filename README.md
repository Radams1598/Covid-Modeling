# Covid-Modeling
Worked with a team as consultants for stakeholders to grasp a better understanding of the socio-economic &amp; demographic factors of people and how it impacts the spread of Covid. Our clients were also interested in building a visualization that will aid in understanding the correlation between socio-economic factors and number of cases, spread, immunity etc. Further analysis aims to determine that if at all there is indeed a correlation, can it be used to predict the spread of Covid in regions / areas with similar demographic structure. The second goal is to analyze the new COVID-19 variants and determine whether their survival is based on their own strength or outside factors.
